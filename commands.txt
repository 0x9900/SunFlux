Most Common Used Filter Commands
Filter Settings: 	Filter settings manually can be time consuming and sometimes hard to comprehend.  I truly believe the best way is to download VE7CC's CC-USER FREE program at: http://ve7cc.net and use it to do your settings.
Filters are mostly default to off, but one simple setting for say someone in the US or Canada that is happy seeing spots from just the US and Canada can do a quick setting for this: SET/FILTER K,VE/PASS
SH/FILTER 	Shows all of your USER filter settings
SH/FILTER <aaa> 	Show setting for specific filter, <aaa> = filter name.
SH/FILTER DOC = DX Origination Country
SH/FILTER DOS = DX Origination State
SH/FILTER AOC = Announce Origination Country
SH/FILTER AOS = Announce Origination State
SH/FILTER WOC = Weather Origination Country
SH/FILTER WOS = Weather Origination State
SH/FILTER DXCTY = DX spot CounTrY
SH/FILTER DXSTATE = DX spot STATE
SET/NOFILTER 	Resets all filters to default.  If you suspect you have entered invalid filter command or commands, reset and start over.
SET/FILTER <aaa>/OFF 	Turn off specific filter.  <aaa> = filter name (see SH/FILTER <aaa>)
SET/FILTER K,VE/PASS 	This would be the most common filter setting for say someone in the United States or Canada to set so as to only see spots that originated in the US or Canada.
SET/FILTER <aaa>/<p/r> <bbb> 	Set specific filter.
<aaa> = filter name (see SH/FILTER <aaa>
<p/r> = PASS or REJECT
<bbb> = Country or State
Example #1:  SET/FILTER DOC/PASS EA,OH,G  This would set your filter to pass originated spots from Spain, Finland and England only.
Example #2:  SET/FILTER DXCTY/PASS F,OH  This would set your filter to pass spots for France and Finland only.
DX Band Mode Filtering 	The DXBM filter has many variations for your settings, it is defaulted to receive all DX spots for all modes from 160 to 10 meters, (see Band & Mode Filtering below).



Band & Mode Filtering
You can tailor the DX spots from CC Cluster to only the bands and modes that interest you.
The default setting for new users is to receive all DX spots from 160 to 10 meters, all modes.
To reset the band/mode filter to pass everything, enter "SET/FILTER DXBM/OFF".
To display your current settings, enter "SH/FILTER DXBM".
You can change any band or band/mode
You can set the band or band/mode to either pass or reject.
You can add items one at a time, or all at once.

For example:
To add 6 meters, you enter "SET/FILTER DXBM/PASS 6".
To delete 80 meter and 40 meter CW, enter "SET/FILTER DXBM/REJECT 80-CW,40-CW"

Although the band/mode has a "mode" name, it does not mean that when you select 40-RTTY that you are selecting only RTTY spots. What it really means is that you are selecting the frequency range in the following table that corresponds to this name. In this case 7040-7100. The actual mode may be anything. The only thing you have selected is a frequency range.

DXBM Frequencies Band Mode 	Low 	High 	Band Mode 	Low 	High 	Band Mode 	Low 	High
